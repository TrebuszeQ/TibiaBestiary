# TibiaBestiary

Fanpage dedicated to Cipsoft's Tibia. Main idea was to create database with every monster, item and place in Tibia to run various methods querying data with various forms.
<br>I've stopped to work on it, when I was on 3000 line of code in array of monsters (like 1/6 of all monsters). I intended to sacrifice my time on something more educative than filling a few enormous arrays so I've moved on to a new project.
